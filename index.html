          <p>I chose to become I.B.E certified because this method solves 3 major problems encountered with the different types of hand-tied extensions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>1st and foremost is the damage to the client's hair and scalp from tension, over-direction and haphazard installs.</p>
            <br>
            <p> 2nd is client discomfort due to the contact of beads on the scalp and the common "clamp and crank" beading approach.</p>
            <br>
            <p> 3rd is the complete lack of versatility and styling options that clients wearing beaded rows experience. Exposed beads, bonds, and braids are all a woman will see when she with her hair up.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am the only certified I.B.E professional in the 225 area. Free Consultations!</p>

            <p>I believe great hair is not achieved unless your hair color is perfect, and the perfect hair color for you is what compliments your skin tone and your eyes.</p>
              ​
             <p> My approach to color is to minimize damage and stress while creating your new look. Using professional quality, high gloss hair color brands along with protective additives is essential to my process. I am able to  maintain the integrity of the hair and promote healthy hair while getting the color you desire.</p>
              ​
              <p> I have mastered my craft through intense education programs for years. To execute methods such as Highlights, Lowlights, Balayage, Ombré, Tint, Color change, and Toner takes practice and patience. I begin every visit with consultation. Communication is the most important and the key ingredient to your perfect visit.</p>

        <p1>I would just like to share my experience with Amanda! I started going to her about 2 years ago when my hair was at its worst! I never thought that I could get it where I wanted it to be again. One of my friends recommended I go and see her. She told me the benefits I could have  from using "Hand Tied Extensions". Y'all, they changed my life! They helped me use less heat on my hair, all while keeping my real hair healthy! They are very comfortable and I could wear my hair up down, whatever way I wanted! And most importantly gave me my confidence back! My hair has grown so much! Thank you Amanda!! You have given me my hair goals back and my hair is the healthiest its ever been!

          So yall go and see Amanda Gautreau, she is hands down THE BEST!!</p1>

        <p1>I schedule my appointments with Amanda at Salon Brushed for my extensions. She’s so amazing to work with! She is very knowledgeable when discussing the best options for my hair and she was right there every step of the way to answer all my questions! I highly recommend Amanda if you are considering extensions. They are an investment and getting the best is worth it!</p1>

        <p1>Great salon! Amanda is my stylist, and let me tell ya... she is nothing short of AMAZING. I came in a hot mess.. I had recently switched from tape in to hand tied extensions, and to say they weren’t working would be an understatement. My  previous method was going to damage my hair, strings were popping out all over the place, and I felt BAD about something that was supposed to make me feel beautiful. I found Amanda by using the IBE stylist locator, from an ad that thankfully popped up. Not only did Amanda do an exceptional job installing my extensions with the IBE method, she corrected my color, and made everything blend beautifully. The salon has a friendly and upbeat atmosphere, and the boutique on the other side has really cute stuff😍 SO happy that I found this 💎</p1>
