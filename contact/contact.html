            Hi, I’m Amanda! I was born and raised right outside of Baton Rouge, 
            and I love everything southern. My dreams to raise a family, perfect my hair styling craft, 
            and have a good time are coming true!
          </p>
        </br>
          <p>
            Hair is hands down my favorite hobby and luckily I get to do it for a living. 
            In 2010 I decided to add extensions to my list of services. 
            I officially became 'Great Lengths Fusion' certified in Miami 
            and 2 years later became 'Great Lengths Cold Fusion' certified in Atlanta. 
          </p>
        </br>
          <p>
            In those years I understood how extensions can help as well as hurt someone’s hair. 
            Craving more knowledge, and seeing how weft extensions were becoming the markets new trend,
            I looked into yet another extension certification for beaded wefts in 2018. However, 3 certifications later,
            I was not convinced that these weft extension were as great as promised. 
          </p>
        </br>
          <p>
            Finally, I found what I was looking for, what all the other methods were lacking. I found Invisible Bead Extensions, a.k.a "I.B.E". 
            In March of 2020 I became certified and the rest was “history”. I.B.E exceeded my, and my clients, expectations. Of course, if
            you know me by now, I enrolled in their Masters Program to become an elite stylist.  
          </p>
        </br>
          <p>
            Extensions and color are my true passions in hair styling. Through I.B.E. I’ve been able to create the best hair that I’ve done in my career.
            After 11 years, I still love getting to see the women who sit in my chair leave with a whole new level of confidence to go on about their day.
