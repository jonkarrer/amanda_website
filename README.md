Day One
Mobile Formatting
[x] create general format.
    --> Giant flexbox, direction in columns.
[x] make navbar.
    --> put a div to width of 100%. Made it a 
      flexbox. Space-between to split logo and dropdown 
      menu. Fixed position, top 0. This makes it stay
      when scrolling.
[x] make landing page.
    --> 100vh, slap an image in the back with the correct
        formatting. Make the display flex to shift the strip
        to the end (right). Make the strip a flex, column, to push words to flex end (bottom). Adjust height of strip to position words.
[x] make second page
    [x] add depth with a white box plus a box shadow. 
        the white "modal". 
    [x] add a logo and content onto the modal.
    [x] make button at the bottom of modal
Day Two
[] make dropdown button function
    --> I am attempting to create an overlay field first. The
        navabar needs to remain on top so i set the z-index of
        the navbar to 2. The overlay is a transparent purple block sitting on top of the main tag. The main tag display is none for now. I want the hamburger button to turn to an x, be white, and connect to the overlay via color match.
[] make third page with fusion method.
[] make link and form for the ibe button
